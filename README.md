- **Frontend** is served from S3 with public read access.
- Make sure CORS on the backend allows requests from your S3.
- EC2 Security Group must allow inbound traffic on port `3000` from your S3 or global IPs.
- Environment variables for the backend (DB credentials, secrets, etc.) are managed via CircleCI and passed to the EC2 instance during deployment.
